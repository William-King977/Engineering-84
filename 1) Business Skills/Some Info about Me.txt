I'm a passionate Computer Science graduate from Swansea University 
with the ability to complete work to a high standard and the eagerness to learn. 

During my spare time, I like to work on some personal projects, 
where I can solidify my knowledge on certain programming languages and challenge myself. 

Now, I'm training with Sparta Global to be come a DevOps Consultant, 
a brilliant opportunity for me to explore a new technical area, 
and I'm excited to see where this will lead me in the upcoming months.



I'm looking forward to working with new technologies, as well as

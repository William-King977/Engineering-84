## Questions and Answers
**Q1: Tell me about yourself.**<br />
**A1:** Hello! I'm William, a Computer Science graduate from Swansea University and during my time at university, I gained an interest in machine learning and 
software development. Since I graduated, I have been working on some personal projects, which are either past academic projects that I wasn't able to fully complete
at the time, or they're new projects I come up with to help solidify my knowledge on certain programming languages. For instance, I recently learnt C++ and I applied
what I have learnt by creating a Battleship program. Now, I am training to become a DevOps consultant with Sparta Global and I'm excited to see where I'll be in the up 
coming weeks.

**Q2: Why Sparta Global?**<br />
**A2:** I chose Sparta Global because of their reputation of being the best tech employer of the year 2020 in the Women in Tech awards, which is a really good and 
notable achievement, as well as, being one of the finalists for the best graduate employer and best employer for training. I have also seen the success stories from other individuals who have given their positive experiences with the training academy and their time with the client. 
That's the same success I want to drive for and I believe I will achieve that with Sparta Global.

**Q3: Where do you see yourself in a few years time?**<br />
**A3:** I first see myself being a Junior DevOps consultant, progressing to a DevOps consultant, then a Senior DevOps consultant with a large, well known company 
and I do see myself putting the work to get towards that level.

**Q4: What is Agile and the benefits of implementing it?**<br />
**A4:** Agile is a software development methodology that focuses on iterative development, responding to changing requirements, and delivering working software quickly, while reducing overheads, such as documentation. The benefits of Agile is that it can lower project risk as there are risk assessments throughout the project, there is ongoing customer engagement, so that the end product will be exactly what the customer wants, and it can adapt to changing requirements to fit customer needs with minimal effort, regardless of the project's progress.

**Q5: What is Scrum and the benefits of implementing it?**<br />
**A5:** Scrum is a form of Agile that focuses on teamwork, accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal through the use of Sprints. The benefits of Scrum is that it is transparent meaning that all of the teams involved will have a full understanding of the project, team quality and effectiveness is increased through the use of the Sprint Retrospective to review their performance, and there will be higher customer satisfaction as they will receive a working increment to review on and changing requirements can be made during the Sprint Review. 

**Q6: What is DevOps and the benefits of using it?**<br />
**A6:** DevOps is the practice of combining both the software development and system operations teams to help deliverer products at a faster pace than traditional 
software development methods. This ensures that they work together across the entire application lifecycle. The benefits of implementing DevOps is that it encourages 
increased colleberation between the teams, products are delivered in smaller but more frequent iterations to better adapt to changing requirements, and there will be an
increase in quality of the product due to automated testing throughout.

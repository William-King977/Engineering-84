## Questions and Answers
**Q1: Tell me about yourself.** <br />
**A1:** Hello! I'm William, a Computer Science graduate from Swansea University and during my time at university, I gained an interest in machine learning and 
software development. Since I graduated, I have been working on some personal projects, which are either past academic projects that I wasn't able to fully complete
at the time, or they're new projects I come up with to help solidify my knowledge on certain programming languages. For instance, I recently learnt C++ and I applied
what I have learnt by creating a Battleship program. Now, I am training to become a DevOps consultant with Sparta Global and I'm excited to see where I'll be in the up 
coming weeks.

**Q2: Why Sparta Global?** <br />
**A2:** I chose Sparta Global because of their reputation of being the best tech employer of the year 2020 in the Women in Tech awards, which is a really good and 
notable achievement. And also being one of the finalists for the best graduate employer and best employer for training.

I also seen the success stories from other individuals who have given their positive experiences with the training academy and their time with the client. 
That's the same success I want to drive for and I believe I will achieve that with Sparta Global.

**Q3: Where do you see yourself in a few years time?** <br />
**A3:** I first see myself being a Junior DevOps consultant, progressing to a DevOps consultant, then a Senior DevOps consultant with a large, well known company 
and I do see myself putting the work to get towards that level.
